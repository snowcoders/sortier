<p>Stay sorted</p>
</div>

Sortier is a code sorter that reorders code so you don't have to. The idea here is if everyone is checking in code that is organized in a similar way, then there will be less conflicts, everyone can expect things to be in the same place in every file, and there is less arguments regarding code styling.

Why not use sort packages from eslint? Searching `eslint sort`, `eslint order`, `tslint sort` or `tslint order` you'll find 30+ packages dealing with sorting or ordering. To be able to get sorting to work over your whole program without these rules interfering with one another would require a lot of trial and error. Instead, we reprint the whole file all at once, with as many sort features as we can think of. It's not only faster but much less of a headache and setup for you!

## Why use sortier?

- Reduce merge conflicts - Two people adding the same import or properties? No longer an issue!
- Read code faster - Since everything is either grouped or sorted alphabetically, scanning code is faster than ever
- Less conversations about ordering - It's automated, conversation done!
